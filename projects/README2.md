# STUDENT RECORD KEEPING SYSTEM DATABASE

The STUDENT RECORD KEEPING SYSTEM DATABASE application is a record management design to track studentsâ€™ education records. Education records contain information about a student, such as administration information, course, major, finance(tuition and cost), health and immunization records, etc.
Because student records should be read/write/update by only authorized users, its user menu only is shown to permitted users. This means that if the user only has a read permit but no written access on the table, the user will not see the table when he/she try to write on the table, even though he/she was able to read the table.
More, because all records are private, student users can only read their data.
